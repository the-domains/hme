The island of Hokkaido accumulates snow in vast amounts during the months of December through to March. It has become a 'mecca' for powder snow lovers across the globe. The region of Niseko has become a well known hub of activity for all things winter. 

Established in 2013 and based in Niseko: 

HOKKAIDO MOUNTAIN EXPERIENCE (HME), has become revered as a specialist provider of professional 'private' snowsports lessons, resort area guiding, backcountry trips and guided Hokkaido tours.

HME engages a small team of handpicked highly qualified individuals who have the ability to ensure guest needs are fulfilled and surpassed, whatever the level of ability or motivation. 

While fortunate to call Niseko home, HME has the luxury to travel further afield to other resorts throughout Hokkaido providing you, your family or travel companions more fun, more experience and adventure. Many of our valued customers take advantage of this service during the winter, visiting Moiwa, Rusutsu and Kiroro. Some even elect to travel further onto other Hokkaido mountains to get the most out of their winter adventures all the while taking in the superb Japanese cuisine and beautiful culture.

Whether a first timer, or a seasoned campaigner join us for a unforgettable Hokkaido Mountain Experience. More Fun, More Experience, More Adventure.
